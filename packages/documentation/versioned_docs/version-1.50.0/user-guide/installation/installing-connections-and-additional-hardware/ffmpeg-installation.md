# Adding FFmpeg and FFprobe to your PATH on Windows

Some parts of Sofie (specifically the Package Manager) require that [`FFmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [`FFprobe`](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) be available in your `PATH` environment variable. This guide will go over how to download these executables and add them to your `PATH`.

### Installation

1. `FFmpeg` and `FFprobe` can be downloaded from the [FFmpeg Downloads page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) under the "Get packages & executable files" heading. At the time of writing, there are two sources of Windows builds: `gyan.dev` and `BtbN` -- either one will work.
2. Once downloaded, extract the archive to some place permanent such as `C:\Program Files\FFmpeg`.
   - You should end up with a `bin` folder inside of `C:\Program Files\FFmpeg` and in that `bin` folder should be three executables: `ffmpeg.exe`, `ffprobe.exe`, and `ffplay.exe`.
3. Open your Start Menu and type `path`. An option named "Edit the system environment variables" should come up. Click on that option to open the System Properties menu.

4. In the System Properties menu, click the "Environment Varibles..." button at the bottom of the "Advanced" tab.

5. If you installed `FFmpeg` and `FFprobe` to a system-wide location such as `C:\Program Files\FFmpeg`, select and edit the `Path` variable under the "System variables" heading. Else, if you installed them to some place specific to your user account, edit the `Path` variable under the "User variables for \<YOUR ACCOUNT NAME\>" heading.

6. In the window that pops up when you click "Edit...", click "New" and enter the path to the `bin` folder you extracted earlier. Then, click OK to add it.

7. Click "OK" to close the Environment Variables window, and then click "OK" again to close the
   System Properties window.
8. Verify that it worked by opening a Command Prompt and executing the following commands:

   ```cmd
   ffmpeg -version
   ffprobe -version
   ```

   If you see version output from both of those commands, then you are all set! If not, double check the paths you entered and try restarting your computer.
